PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Class bunking and student disengagement are major challenges in educational institutions.
These issues negatively impact academic performance and create ineffective learning environments.
Traditional attendance systems are:
  Time-consuming,
  Vulnerable to proxy attendance,
  Lacking real-time monitoring and accountability.

OBJECTIVES:

1.automatically detect and record attendance as students enter the classroom using face recognition.

2.eliminate manual roll calls and prevent proxy attendance.

3.implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning for high-accuracy face recognition.

4.utilize OpenCV for real-time video processing and facial data capture.

5.enable real-time monitoring of students using AI-powered surveillance.












6.maintain a centralized attendance management system for better tracking and reporting.
