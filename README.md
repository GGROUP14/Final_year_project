Class bunking and student disengagement are significant challenges in educational institutions, leading to decreased academic performance and ineffective learning environments.
EduGuard is an AI-powered anti-class bunking system designed to address this issue by integrating face recognition technology with real-time monitoring to ensure accurate
attendance tracking. The system automatically detects and records student attendance when they enter the classroom, eliminating the need for manual roll calls 
and preventing proxy attendance.The proposed system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), OpenCV, and deep learning algorithms for high-accuracy face
detection and recognition.By combining real-time video processing, AI-powered surveillance, and a centralized attendance management system, EduGuard enhances 
student accountability, reduces absenteeism, and fosters a more disciplined learning environment. This innovative solution aims to revolutionize attendance monitoring, 
improve student engagement, and support institutions in maintaining academic integrity.
