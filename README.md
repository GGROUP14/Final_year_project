Problem Statement:
Class bunking and student disengagement are major challenges in educational institutions.
These issues negatively impact academic performance and create ineffective learning environments.
Traditional attendance systems are:
  Time-consuming,
  Manual and prone to human error,
  Vulnerable to proxy attendance,
  Lacking real-time monitoring and accountability.
There is a need for a smart, automated, and secure solution to accurately track student attendance and promote discipline.

Objectives:
To build an AI-powered anti-bunking system for educational institutions.
To implement real-time face recognition using:
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
  OpenCV,
  Deep learning algorithms.
To automate attendance recording as students enter classrooms.
To integrate real-time video surveillance for continuous classroom monitoring.
