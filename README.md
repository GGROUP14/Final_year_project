Problem Statement:

Class bunking and student disengagement are major challenges in educational institutions.
These issues negatively impact academic performance and create ineffective learning environments.
Traditional attendance systems are:
  Time-consuming,
  Vulnerable to proxy attendance,
  Lacking real-time monitoring and accountability.


Objectives:

-To develop an AI-powered attendance and surveillance system for schools and colleges.

-To allow faculty to mark attendance manually through an easy-to-use GUI.

-To detect students marked absent but found outside the classroom using face recognition.

-To raise real-time alerts for students outside without permission.

-To integrate class period timings and automatically handle breaks and schedule changes.

-To ensure each student is only alerted once per class period.

-To allow teachers to give permission for students to be outside when needed.
